Predicting DDoS Attacks using Machine Learning

The objective was to compare multiple ML models and their performance in DDoS attacks.

The project compared Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-Supervised, and Statistical models.

Supervised - Logistic Regression
Unsupervised - KMeans for auto data labeling
Semi-supervised - ANN and ANN + Windowing
Statistical - EWMA and EWMA + Windowing
Prediction Model
